## 🌐 Web3 Social Messaging with Built-in Payments & Community Funding

A decentralized, chat-first platform that combines **real-time messaging, token payments, and community-driven funding** into a single seamless experience.

This project reimagines how people coordinate, transact, and build together online by embedding financial actions directly into conversations. Users can send tokens as easily as messages, contribute to shared group treasuries, and fund ideas through lightweight, on-chain proposals—all without leaving the chat interface.

Built on blockchain infrastructure and modern messaging protocols, the platform bridges the gap between Web2 usability and Web3 ownership.

# ⚙️ Getting Started

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Node.js (>= 18)
- pnpm
- uv (Python Package Manager)
- Stellar CLI (for Soroban Smart Contracts)
- Docker (optional but recommended)

---

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codebestia/clicked.git
cd clicked
pnpm install
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Start all services

First, start the local database and redis container:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Then, run the node apps (Web and Backend):

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

---

### Run individual apps

```bash
# Frontend
pnpm --filter web dev

# Backend API
pnpm --filter backend dev

# AI Service (FastAPI)
cd apps/ai_agent && uv run fastapi dev main.py
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## 📚 Documentation

**➡️ [Documentation index](docs/README.md) — every document in this repository, grouped by
reader: new contributor, backend, frontend, contract developer, operator, security reviewer.**
Start there; it links to everything below and is kept exhaustive.

New to the project? Read the [system architecture overview](docs/architecture-overview.md)
first — one diagram of all four apps and the external services, plus two end-to-end traces.

Frequently opened:

- [Devices & Prekeys API](apps/backend/docs/api-devices.md) — every `/devices` and `/user-devices` route: request/response shapes, ownership checks, prekey upload contract, and revocation side effects
- [E2EE Onboarding Sequence](apps/backend/docs/e2ee-onboarding.md) — device registration and prekey upload flow for first-contact DM setup
- [Contract events reference](contracts/docs/contracts-events.md) — every on-chain event, its payload, and which ones the backend listener consumes
- [WASM size and resource budget](contracts/docs/concepts-resource-budget.md) — the 100 KB per-contract CI gate, current sizes, and headroom
